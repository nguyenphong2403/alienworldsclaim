INCLUDE BOT

We drop all * .json files into the cookies folder (if not, create them) in the bot. The numbering MUST start with 1.json and continue with 2,3,4,5 ... Go to the console (CMD) write cd desktop / awbot Writing python main.py Let's start the bot PS if I forgot to indicate something in the guide, the console will write you what else you need to install. First, it will close all firefox.exe processes, check all the cookies that you have made, if everything goes ok to mine. Sometimes the bot dulls, you just need to restart. If you have a large pool of accounts, then I advise you to run up to 10 accounts first and look at the CPU and RAM load of your Dedicated Server. I hope you will have time to earn at least as much as I do)) All good and cool TLM farming
